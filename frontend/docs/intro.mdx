## 💡 How the AI Assistant Works

Our Teaching Assistant uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, grounded answers:

1. **Your Input** – Ask a question or highlight text from the textbook
2. **Smart Retrieval** – AI finds relevant chapters and sections
3. **Context-Aware Response** – Get answers grounded in the textbook content
4. **Source Attribution** – See exactly where the answer comes from
5. **Learning Reinforcement** – Build deeper understanding through dialogue

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Answers are always based on textbook content
- ✅ Get clarifications on complex concepts
- ✅ Explore related topics and prerequisites
- ✅ Learn at your own pace with personalized guidance
- ✅ Access expert knowledge directly from course materials
